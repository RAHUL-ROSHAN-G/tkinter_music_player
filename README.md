# tkinter_music_player

Hi I am Rahul Roshan G find some intresting code to play a music from your devices without using other apps in your device. Just run this python code and 
select the song by pressing "select song". Features are resume, pause, volume up [up to max], volume down [up to mute], dispaying the song name and volume.
I have used tkinter and pygame for the mixer.

Happy Coding.
